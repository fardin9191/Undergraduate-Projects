 
This project aims to find out if hand gestures can reasonably be used to control the movement 
of a robot or car. This is an easy, user-friendly way to interact with robotic systems and robots. 
There are two main components of the system: The accelerometer depends upon the gestures 
of the hand. Through accelerometer, a passage of data signal is received and it is processed 
with the help of Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller gives command to the robot to 
move in the desired direction. 
 
Robots are playing an important role in automation across all the sectors like construction, 
military, medical, manufacturing, etc. The integration of more and more functionality into the 
human machine interface (HMI) of robots increases the complexity of device handling. Thus, 
optimal use of different human sensory channels is an approach to simplify the interaction with 
robotic devices. Hence, instead of using joystick or physical controller with buttons, hand 
gestures can be used to control a robot. This device can be very useful for surveillance, military 
operations and industrial grade robotic arms for physically challenged individuals.
