◦ Our project is a prototype of digital cash register used for registering and calculating 
transactions. 
◦ It reads the price tag from barcode printed on different products in a form of binary digits 
and then calculates the total price of the products.  
◦ It also has the facility to not only add the price of the product but also subtract the price if 
the customer changes his mind to buy it. 
◦ If any buyer buys multiple same product.Price will be multipled by product number.
