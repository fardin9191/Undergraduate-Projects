 The "IoT Based Smart Egg Hatching System" is an innovative project aimed at
 revolutionizing traditional egg hatching methods by leveraging the power of the
 Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system's primary objective is to
 enhance the efficiency and success rate of egg incubation processes while
 providing real-time monitoring and control to hatchery operators. Integrating
 smart sensors and IoT devices, the system will continuously collect and analyze
 crucial environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, ensuring
 optimal conditions for egg development. Through a user-friendly web or mobile
 interface, hatchery managers can remotely access data, adjust settings, and
 receive instant alerts, thereby fostering an intelligent and automated egg
 hatching process.
