This project involves the complete digital design flow of a **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) master-slave system**. The work includes writing hierarchical RTL code, verifying functionality through a testbench, and performing RTL synthesis to analyze key design metrics such as area, time, and power. The project further covers **Place and Route (PnR)** implementation, **Power-Performance-Area (PPA)** optimization, and **Design Rule Check (DRC)** to ensure the design meets all physical and timing constraints, providing a comprehensive understanding of the SPI design process from concept to physical verification.
