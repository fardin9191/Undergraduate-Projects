 ◦ Measuring the radiation pattern of an LED is crucial for optimizing lighting 
design, aiding in LED selection, and analyzing performance. Understanding 
how light is distributed in space provides valuable insights for achieving 
desired illumination effects, choosing the right LED for specific needs, and 
assessing efficiency and beam quality. 
• Lighting design: Knowing the directionality of emitted light helps achieve 
desired illumination effects.
 • LED selection: Comparing radiation patterns of different LEDs aids in choosing 
the optimal one for specific needs.
 • LED performance analysis: Analyzing the pattern provides insights into 
efficiency and beam quality.

In this project, we present a detailed overview of the experimental setup employed for measuring the radiation pattern of an LED.
The setup encompasses :
 Light sources 
 Detectors 
 Motors for varying radius and angle 
 Microcontroller
 Power supply. 
By carefully controlling environmental conditions and calibrating the equipment, we can obtain reliable data that aids in understanding the LED's performance under different operating conditions.
The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the LED's radiation pattern for different types, colour and size of LEDs under both varying angle and varying radius.
